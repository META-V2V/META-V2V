## 📣 Call for LHT: Support for Left-Hand Traffic in Apollo

We sincerely encourage the Apollo open-source community to consider releasing or documenting support for left-hand traffic (LHT) and right-hand drive (RHD) configurations. While Apollo Go has successfully demonstrated autonomous driving in LHT regions such as Hong Kong [[1](#ref1)], the open-source version does not yet offer support or guidance for such deployment.

> This gap presents a real challenge for researchers and developers in LHT countries—including Japan, the UK, Australia, and others, who are exploring autonomous driving in real-world settings.

We believe that open-sourcing RHD/LHT support (or even partial modular support) would:

- Accelerate local research and prototyping;

- Improve reproducibility of experiments in LHT contexts;

- Encourage global collaboration and standardization;

- Lower the barrier for contributions from non-China-based developers.
